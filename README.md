# bookmark manager

A bookmark is a saved link...


```
As a user,
So that I can see all the bookmarks I have
I would like to be shown a list of all my bookmarks

As a user,
So that I can quickly find web sites I recently bookmarked
I would like to see links in descending chronological order

As a user,
So that I can refer to a website later
I would like the option to save a bookmark

As a user,
So that I can reference the content of a bookmark
I would like to add tags to bookmarks

As a user,
So that I can find the bookmarks matching my query
I would like to filter the list by tags

```
